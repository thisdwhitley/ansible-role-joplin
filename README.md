# Ansible Role: joplin

This is an Ansible role to install the [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) open
source note taking and to-do application with synchronization capabilities.

This happens to be what I am ***currently*** using in an effort to replace
Evernote.  I am syncing via a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) instance
hosted freely at [hostiso](https://hostiso.com/)

## Overview

At a very high level, this role will:

* I have attempted to Ansiblize the developer's installation/update script and
  it is working sufficiently at this point to "install" the AppImage
* [*optional*] I am trying to figure out how to set up the settings including
  synchronization (both done via a sqlite database...)

This role is currently passing my pretty rudimentary tests for the following
operating systems:

* centos7
* fedora27
* fedora28
* fedora29
* ubuntu16
* ubuntu18
* debian8
* debian9

The testing of this role is very specific to the role I've set up in molecule,
but I think I'm ok with that.

## Important Notes

* because of the way that AppImage's are designed, it cannot be done system-wide
  and instead needs to go into a user's home directory, so a user and username
  *MUST* be specified or nothing happens
* I put some effort into finding the type of desktop so I could send it in the
  command like: `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP={{ desktop.stdout }}
  /tmp/Joplin_install_and_update.sh` but it is just not worth the effort.
  Instead, I just blindly put a file in `~/.local/share/applications` and if
  your desktop uses it, GREAT!
* I do ZERO checking of settings if passed.  I found the best way to determine
  what settings were set was to configure Joplin as I wanted it, then to do a
  silly command to find out what was set how:
  `sqlite3 ~/.config/joplin-desktop/database.sqlite .dump | grep '^INSERT INTO
  settings'`  ***UPDATE:*** check out
  [the terminal config page](https://joplinapp.org/terminal/)
* testing the configuration in a container *might not be possible*:

## Requirements

Any package or additional repository requirements will be addressed in the role.

## Role Variables

All of these variables should be considered **optional** however, be aware that
sanity checking is minimal (if at all).  Also, if a user is not passed, nothing
will be done:

* `users` *an AppImage is used per user, and this nested list of users allows
  for the specification of numerous users*
  * `username`
    * this is the username on the OS **NOTE: this role will not create the
      user!**
  * `settings`
    * this is a list of settings with key/value pairs.  I really do not know the
      best way to determine what is a valid key or value so no sanity checking
      is done.  This is because it is simply put into a "settings" table in a
      sqlite database in the users's home directory **please see example**

## Example Playbook

Playbook with various options specified:

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  roles:
    - role: ansible-role-joplin
      users:
        - username: test_usr1
          settings:
            - { key: "sidebarVisibility", val: "1" }
            - { key: "dateFormat", val: "YYYY-MM-DD" }
            - { key: "sync.target", val: "5" }
```

## Inclusion

I envision this role being included in a larger project through the use of a
`requirements.yml` file.  So here is an example of what you would need in your
file:

```yaml
# get the joplin role from github
- src: https://github.com/thisdwhitley/ansible-role-joplin.git
  scm: git
  name: joplin
```

Have the above in a `requirements.yml` file for your project would then allow
you to "install" it (prior to use in some sort of setup script?) with:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install -p ./roles -r requirements.yml
```

## Testing

Testing is not working as well as I'd like at this point.

I am relying heavily on the work by Jeff Geerling in using molecule for testing
this role.  I have, however, modified the tests to make them specific to what I
am attempting to accomplish but this could still use some work.

Please review those files, but here is a list of OSes currently being tested 
(using geerlingguy's container images):

* centos7
* fedora27
* fedora28
* fedora29
* ubuntu16
* ubuntu18
* debian8
* debian9

## To-do

* figure out an appropriate test.  Using AppImages does not work in containers
  [because of FUSE](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE#docker)
